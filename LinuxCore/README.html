<h1>Linux Core Kernel Commentary Readme</h1>

<ul>
    <li><a
        href="LinuxCore/linux-0.01">linux-0.01</a>
        The original Linux kernel distribution, dating from 1991,
        for historical interest. </li>
    <li><a
        href="LinuxCore/linux-2.2.5">linux-2.2.5</a>
        The complete distribution of the version of the kernel
        code used in this book. </li>
    <li><a
        href="LinuxCore/linux-2.2.10">linux-2.2.10</a>
        The latest stable kernel at the time the CD was prepared.
    </li>
    <li><a
        href="LinuxCore/linux-2.3.12">linux-2.3.12</a>
        The latest development kernel at the time the CD was
        prepared. </li>
    <li><a href="LinuxCore/lckc">lckc_code</a>
        All of the code included in this book in a single large
        file with the lines numbered--exactly as it appears in
        the first part of this book. </li>
    <li><a href="LinuxCore/lckc">lckc-find-line.el</a>
        An Emacs Lisp file that defines a simple Emacs Lisp
        function, lckc-find-line, which can make it easier to
        find a line of code in lckc_code given the line number.
        To use it: </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Copy the contents of lckc-find-line.el into your .emacs
        file. </li>
    <li>In a new Emacs (one that has read the updated .emacs
        file), open lckc_code, then type the following: <pre>Esc x lckc-find-line
</pre>
        <p>and type Return. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Emacs prompts you for the line number. Type in the line
        number, followed by Return. Emacs jumps to the given
        line. (Note to Emacs aficionados: This is not the same as
        <strong>goto-line</strong>, because there are lines in
        the file that don't have line numbers.) </li>
</ol>

<h3>Tags Files</h3>

<p>Except for the version 0.01 kernel, I've added tags files to
all of the kernel distributions. Various editors can use tags
files to jump directly to a function or variable definition, to
perform intelligent searches through a set of source files, and
so on. </p>

<p>Inside each of the 2.x distribution directories, you'll find a
file named TAGS.all, which was built by running the etags program
over every source file in the distribution. There are also files
named TAGS.alpha, TAGS.arm, TAGS.i386, and so on; each of these
was built by running etags on the code specific to a single port
of the kernel and all of the architecture-independent code. For
instance, if you're interested in searching both the
architecture-independent code and the i386-specific (that is,
Intel-specific) code, use TAGS.i386. </p>

<p>The files that start with &quot;TAGS&quot; are Emacs-specific.
The vi-specific versions of the same files have the same names,
except that the files are named "vitags" instead of "TAGS"
(e.g., use&quot;vitags.i386&quot; for vi, &quot;TAGS.i386&quot; for Emacs). </p>

<h3>Using Tags Files In Emacs</h3>

<p>In Emacs (my editor of choice), you can jump to the definition
of the <b>PAGE_SIZE</b> macro with the following procedure: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Type <pre>Esc .
</pre>
        <p>(that is, type the Escape key followed by a period). </p>
    </li>
    <li>Emacs prompts for the tag to locate. Type <b>PAGE_SIZE</b>
        and hit Return. </li>
    <li>Emacs prompts for the location of the tags file. Type in
        the path to the tags file and hit Return. </li>
</ol>

<p>That's it--Emacs opens the correct source file and places the
cursor on the line where <b>PAGE_SIZE</b> is defined. After that,
if you search for another tag, it's the same procedure, except
that Emacs doesn't prompt you for the tags file again. It assumes
you want to keep using the tags file until you tell it otherwise
with the <strong>visit-tags-table</strong> command. </p>

<p>Emacs can also search for all occurrences of a tag: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Type <pre>Esc x tags-search
</pre>
        <p>followed by Return. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Emacs prompts for the tag to seek. Type in the tag,
        followed by Return. </li>
    <li>Emacs locates the first occurrence of the tag (not
        necessarily its definition), opens the source file, and
        places the cursor just after the tag. </li>
    <li>To search for the next occurrence of the tag, type <pre>Esc ,
</pre>
        <p>(that is, the Escape key followed by a comma). You can
        do this repeatedly; Emacs will beep when there are no
        more occurrences of the tag. </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>tags-search </strong>command actually searches all
text in the files that were used to build the tags file, even
text in comments. What's more, it searches for a regular
expression, not just literal text. Consult Emacs's online
documentation for more information about Emacs regular
expressions. </p>

<h3>Using Tags Files In Vi</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Tell vi to load the tags file: <pre>:set tags=tagfilename
</pre>
        <p>Of course, you should replace <strong><i>tagfilename</i></strong>
        with the name of the tags file you want to use. Don't
        forget to include the path to the file, if necessary
        (that is, if the tags file isn't in the directory from
        which you started vi). </p>
        <p>To find the <b>PAGE_SIZE</b> macro, type the
        following: </p>
        <pre>:ta PAGE_SIZE
</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>As you'd expect, once the tags file is loaded, you don't need
to repeat Step 1 every time. </p>

<p>Both Emacs and vi have more sophisticated tags-related
functions, which you can learn about by reading the editors'
documentation. </p>
